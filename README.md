This is a docx file created for importing into Logos "Personal books". The file was exported from Apple Pages. The endnotes (many are Bible references) were re-entered from the original to work with Logos Mouse-overs. The headings shown in the original will not perfectly import into Logos because Logos import is pretty rubbish. However the basic document looks good and works well.
